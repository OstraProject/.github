Hi there ðŸ‘‹
***We are Ostra Project***
----
We (well, for now, just me) are trying to make a high-quality, practical, convenient Linux distribution based on Ubuntu!

----
**The main differences of our distribution:**
1. KDE Plasma 6 - provides comfortable use of the system, also providing a comfortable transition from Windows.
2. Optimization for games - Proton, Lutris, Wine and Steam out of the box.
3. Light weight - takes up less disk space.
4. Custom Themes

Project stage: beginning of development
